        <p>This is the personal diary of the celebrity cat, Rue Sebastian Jackson. 
            All of these thoughts belong to Rue Jackson and do not reflect those of anyone else. I am currently 3, soon to be 4. The full diary of my third year of life will be 
            released April 11th, 2022 exclusively on RueyJackson.com. Below are excerpts of the full diares.

    <h2>Year Zero</h2>
        <p>"My mother says she found me somewhere in Valley Stream. My earliest memories are in Albany, while my mom was in college. 
            I lived with some anxiety-ridden cat that they called Charlie. He was annoying, but very easy to bully. 
            I used to beat up that poor cat all the time and eat his food. I feel bad looking back on it.
            Sometimes I wonder how Charlie is doing. I hope he has toughened up a bit. His mom was a wierdo like him, 
            but I hope they are doing fine."
        </p>
    <h2>Year One</h2>
        <p>"My broke ass mother moved us back in with my grandmother. Also that old dog that pees everywhere died. I tried to 
            show her where my litter box is, but she didnt want anything to do with it. Also, everyone is suddenly home all day? 
            Idk what the fuck is going on but my mom better not have quit her job. I need my chewy shipments."
        </p>
    <h2>Year Two</h2>
        <p>"They never fully went back to work? I have also realized how much I hate my mother. She always wants to touch me. I need to 
            stay on her good side however because she buys my favorite treats from Whole Foods. She's still vegan too! Definitely was not 
            expecting that. I do like hanging out with Ryan though. He gives me food whenever I want it."
